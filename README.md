# TIWIZI

is a tool whose the goal is to help meta-model designers, during their work.

TIWIZI is paired with a model generator, named GRIMM.

# Download it

You can clone the project. It is totally open source.


# How it works

This is a *fault localizer* for model generation process. The input of TIWIZI are: an ecore meta-model and candidate values.
Candidate values give the number of instances per class you want to generate. For specifying candidate values, you can use .grimm files exactly as in [grimm](https://adel-ferdjoukh.ovh/grimm/) tool
